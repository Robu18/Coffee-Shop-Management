# Coffee Shop Management

• Employed object-oriented principles, such as encapsulation and inheritance, to create a well-structured codebase.
• Created classes for Manager, Employee, Table, and various drink types (e.g., Coffee and Tea) with associated member functions and attributes.
• Utilized C++ Standard Library containers, like std::vector, to store collections of objects, streamlining data management.
• Enabled dynamic memory allocation for objects and employed proper memory management techniques to prevent memory leaks.
• Designed a user-friendly menu system for both managers and employees with clear options and interactive user interfaces.
• Created a user authentication system, allowing both managers and employees to access role-specific features.
• Employed regex for tasks such as email and password validation, contributing to a robust user authentication system.
• Implemented the Singleton design pattern for the Manager class, ensuring a single instance of the manager object is accessible throughout the application, promoting centralized control and resource management.
