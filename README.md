# Coffee Shop Management

 • Implemented a command-line interface built with object-oriented concepts in C++, which handles CRUD commands for specific roles and uses regex for email and password validation.
 • Utilized encapsulation, inheritance, exception handling, and dynamic memory allocation for objects and collections, and employed memory management techniques to prevent memory leaks.
 • Provided a Singleton design pattern for the Manager class, ensuring a single instance of the object is accessible throughout the application, promoting centralized control and resource management.
